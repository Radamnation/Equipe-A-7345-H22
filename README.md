[Project Doomlike] <br />


[WORK QUALITY NOTE] <br />


... DATE OF PRODUCTION <br />
... ... Winter 2022 <br />
... ... 3 months schoool project <br />
... ... ... As part of the [Game Engine II] project with self imposed theme by & René Adam-Riché & Sébastien Léveques: "DoomLike" <br />


... CODE QUALITY <br />
... ... Done during our fourth semester studying programmation <br />
... ... The main goal for both owners was to implement as much quality scriptable Object oriented architecture as possible, referencing ourselves to the [Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects]'s video <br />


... DESIGN LOGIC <br />
... ... The goal was to create a modern twist on the old-school 2.5D games from id Software and the likes <br />
... ... Map layout is to be generated dynamically based on prefabs of rooms <br />
... ... A diegetic HUB is to exist for the player to relax in and to test weapons between runs <br />
